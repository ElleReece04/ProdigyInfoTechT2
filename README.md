# Guess the Number Game

This is a simple Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user is challenged to guess the number. The program provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low and continues until the correct number is guessed. It then displays the number of attempts it took to win the game.

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` file.

2. Enter your guess when prompted.

3. Follow the feedback provided by the program to adjust your guess.

4. Continue guessing until you guess the correct number.

5. Once you guess the correct number, the program will display the number of attempts it took.
